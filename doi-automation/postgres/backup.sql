g5k8-8sud	Program Budget Operating Budget Vs Expense Raw Data	Financial Services	dataset	2013	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/g5k8-8sud	City of Austin current budget fiscal year Operating Budget showing budget versus expenditures.  This budget is at the Fund, Department, Unit level.  This data set includes a build date and will be updated on a quarterly basis.  The data contained in this data set is for informational purposes. Certain Austin Energy budget items have been excluded as competitive matters under Texas Government Code Section 552.133 and City Council Resolution 20051201-002.\r\n\r\nThe comparison of actual expenditures to budget may appear inconsistent. That is because base wages for personnel are fully budgeted in the expense categories regular wages—full-time, regular wages—part-time or regular wages—civil service. The budget does not assume expenditure levels for the various leave categories, such as sick pay, vacation pay, or jury leave. However, actual expenses for various leave categories are recorded based on timesheet coding. The result is that actual expenditures for regular wages are spread across multiple expense categories while the budget is shown in one expense category.\r\n\r\nPersonnel savings is budgeted to account for the likely savings in personnel costs generated through attrition. However, the savings is realized in the expense categories regular wages—full-time, regular wages—part-time and regular wages—civil service. Therefore, the actual expenditures in the personnel savings expense category will always be zero.	\N

5zpr-dehc	Traffic Signals on Flash	Austin Transportation	dataset	2016	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/5zpr-dehc	This dataset reports flashing traffic signals in Austin, TX. Traffic signals enter flash mode when something is preventing the signal from operating normally. This is typically the result of a power surge, power outage, or damage to signal equipment. A signal may also be intentionally placed into flash mode for maintenance purposes or be scheduled to flash overnight. \r\n\r\nYou can view an interactive map of flashing traffic signals here:\r\nhttp://transportation.austintexas.io/signals-on-flash\r\n\r\nYou can view a historical data set of signals that have flash in the past, here:\r\nhttps://data.austintexas.gov/dataset/Traffic-Signal-Status-Historical-BETA-/x62n-vjpq/edit_metadata\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately 90% of the City’s signals communicate with our Advanced Trasnportation Management System. When these signals go on flash, they will be reported in this dataset. Although we are extending communications to all signals, approximately 10% are not currently captured in this dataset. It also occasionally happens that the event that disables a traffic signal also disables network communication to the signal, in which case the signal outage will not be reported here.\r\n\r\nIn this dataset the distinction between scheduled and unscheduled flash is identified by the 'operation state' column. A signal that is in unscheduled flash mode will have a status of 2 or 7. A signal that is in in scheduled flash mode will have a status of 1.\r\n\r\nThis product is for informational purposes and may not have been prepared for or be suitable for legal, engineering, or surveying purposes.

9xdm-yhmb	Austin Energy Customer Data by Customer Class	Austin Energy	dataset	2015	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/9xdm-yhmb	Austin Energy has four main customer classes: residential, commercial, industrial, and other. \r\n\r\nResidential customers live in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses, or individually metered apartment units. \r\n\r\nThe majority of commercial customers are small to large businesses that fall under Austin Energy’s secondary level of service. This means Austin Energy owns, operates, and maintains the equipment (wires, transformers, etc.) supplying power to those facilities. \r\n\r\nIndustrial (Primary) customers take service at high voltage (12,500 volts or higher) and own, operate and maintain their own equipment. Consequently, Austin Energy experiences lower overall system losses and it costs less to serve these customers. Large commercial and industrial customers such as semiconductors, high-tech facilities, and data centers typically fall under the primary level of service. These customers have very high usage and load factors because they tend to operate 24/7. \r\n\r\nThe final class, other, typically refers to street lighting and facilities such as ballparks.	\N

692b-xsit	Concentrations of Protected Classes from Analysis of Impediments	Neighborhood Housing and Community Development	dataset	2015	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/692b-xsit	A new component of fair housing studies is an analysis of the opportunities residents are afforded in “racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty,” also called RCAPs or ECAPs. An RCAP or ECAP is a neighborhood with significant concentrations of extreme poverty and minority populations.\r\nHUD’s definition of an RCAP/ECAP is:\r\n•\tA Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND a poverty rate of 40 percent or more; OR\r\n•\tA Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND the poverty rate is three times the average tract poverty rate for the metro/micro area, whichever is lower.\r\n\r\nWhy the 40 percent threshold? The RCAP/ECAP definition is not meant to suggest that a slightly‐lower‐than‐40 percent poverty rate is ideal or acceptable. The threshold was borne out of research that concluded a 40 percent poverty rate was the point at which a neighborhood became significantly socially and economically challenged. Conversely, research has shown that areas with up to 14 percent of poverty have no noticeable effect on community opportunity. (See Section II in City of Austin’s 2015 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice: http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/NHCD/Reports_Publications/1Analysis_Impediments_for_web.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis dataset provides socioeconomic data on protected classes from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey on census tracts in Austin’s city limits and designates which of those tracts are considered RCAPs or ECAPs based on these socioeconomic characteristics. A map of the census tracts designated as RCAPs or ECAPs is attached to this dataset and downloadable as a pdf (see below).	\N

hc5t-p62z	Final Report of the Asian American Quality of Life (AAQoL)	Public Information Office	dataset	2018	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/hc5t-p62z	The U.S. Census defines Asian Americans as individuals having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent (U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 1997). As a broad racial category, Asian Americans are the fastest-growing minority group in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). The growth rate of 42.9% in Asian Americans between 2000 and 2010 is phenomenal given that the corresponding figure for the U.S. total population is only 9.3% (see Figure 1). Currently, Asian Americans make up 5.6% of the total U.S. population and are projected to reach 10% by 2050. It is particularly notable that Asians have recently overtaken Hispanics as the largest group of new immigrants to the U.S. (Pew Research Center, 2015). The rapid growth rate and unique challenges as a new immigrant group call for a better understanding of the social and health needs of the Asian American population.	\N

qmdk-sha4	Number of Austin Energy Customers 2015	Austin Energy	dataset	2016	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/qmdk-sha4	As part of the FY 2013 rate case, Austin Energy restructured its customer classes. \r\n\r\nAustin Energy’s four customer classes include: \r\n\r\nResidential — customers living in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses or individually metered apartment units. \r\n\r\nSecondary — commercial customers including small to large businesses. This means Austin Energy owns, operates and maintains the equipment supplying power to those facilities . \r\nSecondary 1 — commercial customers served at less than 10 kW. \r\nSecondary 2 — commercial customers served between 10 and 50 kW. Secondary 3 — commercial customers served at more than 50 kW. \r\n\r\nPrimary — customers that take service at high voltage and own, operate and maintain their own equipment. Consequently, Austin Energy experiences lower overall system losses and expense in serving these customers. Large commercial and industrial customers such as semiconductors, hightech facilities and data centers typically fall under this level of service. These customers have very high usage and load factors because they tend to operate 24/7. \r\nPrimary 1 — commercial customers served at less than 3 MW. \r\nPrimary 2 — commercial customers served between 3 and 20 MW. \r\nPrimary 3 — commercial customers served at more than 20 MW.\r\n\r\nContract/Transmission — customers owning and maintaining all equipment on the customer side for electric delivery and receiving service at 69 kV or above. Contract applies to a small number of large commercial customers operating under legacy contracts. \r\n\r\nLighting — typically refers to street lighting and facilities including ballparks.	\N

psd6-eiah	Proposed Corridor Construction Program	Capital Planning Office	dataset	2018	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/psd6-eiah	The following 34 "investment packages" were derived from recommendations in Corridor Mobility Plans for the nine corridors eligible for 2016 Mobility Bond construction funding in accordance with the ballot language approved by voters in November 2016. Those corridors are: North Lamar Boulevard, Burnet Road, Airport Boulevard, East MLK Jr. Boulevard/FM969, South Lamar Boulevard, East Riverside Drive, Guadalupe Street, William Cannon Drive and Slaughter Lane. The investment packages below equal an estimated $1.4 billion in mobility, safety, and connectivity improvements across the nine corridoes. The packages underwent a comparative analysis to identify the packages that would result in the biggest bang for the buck. \r\n\r\nThe packages were divided into two improvement categories: Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements and Enhanced Multimodal Improvements. Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements generally include the ‘short-term’ recommendations from the Corridor Mobility Plans. These provide improvements across all modes along the entire length of the corridors, including pavement rehabilitation, intersection improvements, traffic signal upgrades, transit signal priority, better connections to transit stops, continuous ADA-compliant sidewalks along the length of the corridor, continuous bicycle lanes or shared-use paths along the length of the corridors, and in some cases intermittent median islands for safety. Enhanced Multimodal Improvements generally include the ‘long-term’ recommendations from the Corridor Mobility Plans. While each corridor is different, and the specific improvements may vary, the Enhanced Multimodal Improvements are intended to bring each corridor up to the ultimate vision established in the Corridor Mobility Plan. These improvements build upon the Corridor-wide Mobility Improvements and add full street reconstruction, wider sidewalks, protected bicycle lanes, intermittent median islands for safety, and streetscape improvements, such as landscaping and trees.\r\n\r\nEach package has three estimated costs: low, most likely, and high. The low represents the upper limit of the cost with a 10% confidence level, the most likely a 70% confidence level, and the high a 90% confidence level. This range is due to the level of information we have right now, and is typical of infrastructure project development. \r\n\r\nCity of Austin staff is proposing three approaches to funding the estimated $1.4 billion in projects: Full design and construction, Initiate Design and Possible Construction, Seek Additional Funding Opportunities. Full design and construction: Investment package will be fully funded through 2016 Mobility Bond funding and other partnership/coordination opportunities. Initiate design and possible construction: The City will start design of improvements in the investment package and the City will be seek funding and partnership opportunities to fund the project through completion. Seek additional funding opportunities: The City will seek to implement the improvements through partnership/coordination opportunities, and will seek additional funding opportunities.\r\n\r\nAll recommendations are approximate, proposed, and subject to change. The exact locations of improvements will be determined in the Project Design Phase, and the City will work with the community prior to project construction.	\N

jrzy-k38j	ARR Employee Commute Reduction Program	Austin Resource Recovery	dataset	2016	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/jrzy-k38j	In April, 2015, City Manager Marc Ott implemented the Employee Commute Reduction Program by directing all City of Austin departments to reduce employee commuting during peak periods by 20 percent.  This can be accomplished by teleworking, working alternative hours, working condensed schedules, and reducing single occupancy trips during peak hours.  By collecting baseline data regarding employees' schedules and commute habits, it was determined that nearly 74% of ARR's possible on peak commutes were already reduced by travelling off peak periods, using alternative schedules, teleworking, or by utilizing alternative transportation.  Austin Resource Recovery wanted to do even more and responded to the City Manager's initiative by implementing alternative work schedules for its administrative employees and encouraging reduction of single occupancy trips by utilizing public transportation, carpooling, and the vanpool program.	\N

ac5x-csd7	Austin Resource Recovery Telework Pilot	Austin Resource Recovery	dataset	2016	https://data.austintexas.gov/d/ac5x-csd7	During the City's Employee Commute Reduction Program, Austin Resource Recovery partnered with the non-profit Movability Austin to create a Mobility Plan for the department in order to further reduce on peak commutes and emissions caused by single occupancy vehicles.  One major strategy to achieve this goal was to implement a telework pilot.  ARR developed a telework policy and provided training to all participating employees and their managers.  The telework pilot ran from February 8, 2016, to May 6, 2016.  During this time, measures were taken regarding employees' schedules and commute habits as well as miles driven and estimated MPG of their cars in order to calculate emissions.  Surveys were also taken to gauge employee satisfaction and productivity associated with teleworking.  After reviewing the data and results from the pilot, ARR Director Bob Gedert approved the telework pilot to make it an official departmental program in July, 2016.	\N
