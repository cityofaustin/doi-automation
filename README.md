# DOI Automation

Datacite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataCite) is a non profit organization which provides an easy way to access datasets online.
The City of Austin would like to use this organization's tools to give the public a simple and effective way to cite our open data for any use.

This project's goal is to explore and implement an integration for DataCite's citation archives with the 
Socrata Open Data portal. This will be done by developing automation to synchronize datacite's DOI archive with the City of Austin's socrata portal assets and metadata.
